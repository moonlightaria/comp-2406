dependacies: 
http
fs
path
pug

run instuctions:
node server.js
ensure the following files share a directory with the server.js on execution
/pug (contains the pug files)
/vendors (contains the vendor json files)
styles.css
client.js
add.png
remove.png

design desisions:
prioratized sending min data between client and server (faster to do extra cpu computation over waiting for data since no cpu bottleneck, less need to synconize state)
converted all html to pug to use header partial and for practice
tried using objects are paired arrays for storing data, paired array didn't work very well
